## The Problem

In the Indian judicial system, tax authorities appeal 90% of cases they lose, yet win fewer than 10% of these appeals. This flood of low-merit litigation paralyzes the entire system, causing delays and wasting resources.

## The Solution

Tax Litigation CoPilot provides objective, data-driven recommendations to help tax officers:

- Reduce unnecessary appeals that have low chances of success
- Identify high-value cases that are worth pursuing
- Save time and resources by focusing on merit-based litigation
